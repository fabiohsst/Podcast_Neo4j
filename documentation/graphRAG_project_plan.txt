GraphRAG Project Plan for Podcast Episode Knowledge Graph
========================================================

1. What is GraphRAG?
--------------------
GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines a knowledge graph (like your Neo4j database) with LLMs (Large Language Models) to:
- Retrieve relevant nodes, relationships, and context from the graph in response to a user query.
- Feed this structured context to the LLM to generate accurate, context-aware, and grounded responses.

2. How Does the :SIMILAR_TO Relationship Help?
----------------------------------------------
- Enables semantic navigation: Quickly find episodes that are thematically close, even if they don't reference each other directly.
- Improves recommendations: Surface high-quality, content-based suggestions for related or complementary episodes.
- Enhances context expansion: Retrieve not just directly relevant episodes, but also their most similar neighbors, enriching the context for the LLM.

3. Project Planning: Steps and Components
-----------------------------------------
A. Data Preparation & Graph Enrichment
   - Ensure all episode transcripts are chunked and embedded.
   - Maintain :SIMILAR_TO relationships for semantic similarity.
   - Optionally, add more metadata (tags, guests, topics) to nodes for richer retrieval.

B. Retrieval Layer
   - Query Understanding: Use LLM or keyword extraction to identify user intent and key topics.
   - Graph Search:
     - Retrieve relevant TranscriptSegment nodes using full-text search, keyword match, or embedding similarity.
     - Expand context by traversing :SIMILAR_TO and :REFERENCES relationships to gather related episodes and segments.
     - Optionally, use community/cluster info to suggest broader themes or learning paths.

C. Context Construction
   - Aggregate retrieved transcript segments, episode metadata, and relationships into a context window for the LLM.
   - Optionally, summarize or rank segments to fit within token limits.

D. LLM Generation
   - Feed the constructed context and the user's question to the LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, etc.).
   - Generate answers, recommendations, or episode paths.

E. Recommendation & Pathfinding
   - Episode Recommendation: Use :SIMILAR_TO and :REFERENCES to suggest episodes that complement or extend a topic.
   - Path Generation: Use graph algorithms (e.g., shortest path, personalized PageRank) to create a sequence of episodes connecting two topics or episodes.

F. Chatbot Interface
   - Build a conversational interface (web, mobile, or messaging app).
   - Maintain conversation history to personalize recommendations and context.

4. How to Use :SIMILAR_TO in GraphRAG
-------------------------------------
- Context Expansion: Retrieve the most relevant episode(s) and their :SIMILAR_TO neighbors to provide a richer, more nuanced answer.
- Episode Recommendations: Suggest episodes with high similarity to the discussed topic.
- Learning Paths: Use :SIMILAR_TO and :REFERENCES to build a path of episodes for progressive learning or exploration.

5. Advanced Insights & Ideas
---------------------------
- Personalization: Track user interactions and use collaborative filtering or graph-based personalization to refine recommendations.
- Hybrid Retrieval: Combine embedding-based search (semantic) with graph traversal (structural/contextual) for best results.
- Explainability: Use the graph structure to explain why an episode is recommended ("This episode is similar to the one you just listened to because…").
- Community-Aware Suggestions: Suggest episodes from the same community/cluster for thematic depth, or from different communities for breadth.

6. Example User Flows
---------------------
- Ask a Question:
  "What episodes discuss cognitive biases?"
  → Retrieve relevant segments/episodes, expand with :SIMILAR_TO, generate a summary, and recommend further listening.

- Episode Recommendation:
  "I liked episode 42, what should I listen to next?"
  → Use :SIMILAR_TO and :REFERENCES to suggest next episodes.

- Learning Path:
  "I want to learn about memory, where should I start?"
  → Use graph algorithms to create a path of episodes covering the topic, possibly spanning multiple communities.

7. Technical Stack Suggestions
-----------------------------
- Backend: Python (with Neo4j driver, FastAPI/Flask for API)
- LLM: OpenAI GPT, Claude, or open-source models (via API)
- Frontend: Streamlit, React, or chatbot frameworks
- Graph Algorithms: Neo4j GDS for clustering, pathfinding, ranking

8. Next Steps
-------------
1. Define your MVP use cases (Q&A, recommendations, learning paths).
2. Prototype retrieval and context construction using your graph.
3. Integrate with an LLM and test outputs.
4. Build and iterate on the chatbot interface.

9. Further Breakdowns
---------------------

A. Data Preparation & Graph Enrichment
   - Transcript Chunking:
     - Split episode transcripts into coherent segments (e.g., by time, topic, or speaker turns).
     - Store each segment as a node (TranscriptSegment) linked to its episode.
   - Embedding Generation:
     - Use a sentence-transformer or similar model to embed each transcript segment.
     - Store embeddings as properties on TranscriptSegment nodes.
   - Metadata Enrichment:
     - Add episode-level metadata (title, description, guests, tags, publication date).
     - Optionally, extract and store key topics or entities from transcripts.
   - Graph Relationships:
     - Maintain :SIMILAR_TO relationships for semantic similarity.
     - Use :REFERENCES for explicit links between episodes or external resources.
     - Optionally, add :HAS_TOPIC or :FEATURES_GUEST relationships for richer navigation.

B. Retrieval Layer
   - Query Understanding:
     - Use keyword extraction, entity recognition, or LLM-based intent detection to parse user queries.
     - Map queries to relevant topics, episodes, or transcript segments.
   - Retrieval Strategies:
     - Full-text search on transcript content for keyword matches.
     - Embedding similarity search for semantic matches (using vector search or ANN libraries).
     - Graph traversal to expand context via :SIMILAR_TO, :REFERENCES, or community relationships.
   - Ranking & Filtering:
     - Rank retrieved segments/episodes by relevance, recency, or user preferences.
     - Filter out low-confidence or off-topic results.

C. Context Construction
   - Context Windowing:
     - Aggregate retrieved transcript segments and metadata into a context window for the LLM.
     - Prioritize the most relevant or diverse content to fit within token limits.
   - Summarization:
     - Use extractive or abstractive summarization to condense long transcripts or multiple segments.
     - Optionally, generate bullet-point summaries for clarity.
   - Token Management:
     - Monitor and manage token usage to avoid exceeding LLM input limits.
     - Truncate or summarize as needed.

D. LLM Generation
   - Prompt Engineering:
     - Design prompts that clearly instruct the LLM to use the provided context and cite sources.
     - Include episode titles, timestamps, or URLs for traceability.
   - Grounding & Validation:
     - Ensure the LLM's responses are grounded in the retrieved context.
     - Optionally, use retrieval-augmented validation or reranking to improve factuality.
   - Response Formatting:
     - Structure responses for clarity (e.g., numbered lists, sections, or direct quotes).

E. Recommendation & Pathfinding
   - Graph Algorithms:
     - Use shortest path, personalized PageRank, or community detection to find relevant episode paths.
     - Score paths by thematic coherence, diversity, or user interest.
   - User Feedback Loops:
     - Collect user feedback on recommendations to refine future suggestions.
     - Adapt pathfinding and ranking based on user preferences and history.

F. Chatbot Interface
   - Session Management:
     - Track user sessions and conversation history for context continuity.
     - Store user preferences, listened episodes, and feedback.
   - Personalization:
     - Tailor recommendations and responses based on user profile and past interactions.
     - Offer personalized learning paths or episode playlists.
   - UI/UX Best Practices:
     - Design a clean, intuitive interface for chat and recommendations.
     - Provide clear navigation, search, and feedback options.
     - Ensure accessibility and responsiveness across devices.
