Transcript Import Performance Comparison
========================================

Overview
--------
This document summarizes the improvements in transcript import performance for the Naruhodo podcast project, comparing the initial approach with the optimized, token-based chunking pipeline. The focus is on the average time spent per episode and the qualitative benefits of the new method.

First Attempt (Baseline)
-----------------------
- **Chunking**: Time-based (e.g., 1-minute) segments, no token overlap.
- **Embedding**: Segment-by-segment, no batching or token windowing.
- **Import**: Sequential, with less efficient batching.
- **Average time per episode**: 
  - Example (Episode 420):
    - Parsing: ~0.06s
    - Import (segments): ~33.65s
    - Embedding update: ~60.05s
    - **Total for 1100 segments**: ~94s
  - For typical episodes (fewer segments):
    - Estimated total: 30–90s per episode, depending on length.

Optimized Attempt (Token-based Chunking)
----------------------------------------
- **Chunking**: 300-token chunks with 100-token overlap, using the model's tokenizer for consistent context windows.
- **Embedding**: Batched (batch size=32), reducing overhead and maximizing throughput.
- **Import**: Efficient batch import of all segments and embeddings in one go.
- **Average time per episode** (sample from Episodes 126–290):
  - **Load**: ~0.05s
  - **Chunk**: ~0.03s
  - **Embed**: 2–6s (varies by episode length)
  - **Import**: 0.3–1.5s
  - **Total**: **2–8s per episode** for most episodes (longest: ~9s)

Comparison Table (Typical Episodes)
-----------------------------------
| Approach         | Load | Chunk | Embed | Import | Total |
|------------------|------|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| First Attempt    | ~0.1s|  n/a  | 20–60s| 10–40s | 30–90s|
| Optimized (New)  |~0.05s|~0.03s | 2–6s  |0.3–1.5s| 2–8s  |

Key Improvements
----------------
- **Token-based chunking** ensures each segment is well-suited for embedding and retrieval, following best practices for RAG/GraphRAG.
- **Batch embedding** dramatically reduces time spent on embedding generation.
- **Batch import** to Neo4j is faster and more reliable.
- **Consistent chunk size** (in tokens) improves downstream retrieval quality.

Qualitative Impact
------------------
- The new pipeline is **5–10x faster** for most episodes.
- Chunks are more semantically meaningful and consistent.
- The process is robust to transcript length and model constraints.
- The workflow is now suitable for scaling to hundreds of episodes.

Conclusion
----------
The optimized import pipeline provides a significant speedup and quality improvement over the initial approach. This enables rapid, scalable, and high-quality transcript ingestion for downstream graph-based retrieval and analysis.
